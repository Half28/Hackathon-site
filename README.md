# Hackathon-site
Website for the NucleoTide Hackathon, made in two days.

Please note that the MDBootstrap files included are downloaded directly from the site, I only included them for ease of replication. The documentation for said files can be found here: https://mdbootstrap.com/

This code is fully commented, as I wanted to explain it to a friend. Feel free to redistribute or modify as you please, so long as you are not in the hackathon and give me the proper credit. If you find any issues (which is more likely than normal due to the fact that it was thrown together in two days), please issue a pull request.

I learned a lot about web development through this hackathon. Before, I could do basic things like make a simple webpage with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS, but that was really the extent of my knowledge. Not only did I learn how to animate text and other elements, I worked with MDBootstrap for the first time. I'd say it turned out rather well for its rushed nature, but do tell me if you have a suggestion for how it could be improved!

# Purpose
For this hackathon, we decided to choose the prompt that dealt with education. Although there were multiple prompts, we felt like there was a niche for education about bioinformatics. Aside from the standard bio classes in high school, I didn't even know much about it, so doing research and making a site about it really improved our knowledge on the subject. 

# Authors
Sophia worked on the content of the site and gathering information, as well as logo and favicon design.

Connor coded the site, and did mild research on amino acid proteins.
